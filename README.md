# QuantumSafeAI: Quantum-Resistant Encryption for the Future

## üöÄ **Project Overview**
As quantum computing technology advances, traditional encryption methods face increasing vulnerabilities. Quantum computers have the potential to break widely used cryptographic algorithms, posing a significant threat to global cybersecurity. *QuantumSafeAI* is an AI-powered quantum-safe encryption project designed to address these challenges head-on by integrating quantum-resistant encryption techniques and proactive AI strategies to secure sensitive data in the post-quantum era.

## üß† **What is Quantum-Safe Encryption?**
Quantum-safe encryption leverages algorithms designed to withstand attacks from both classical and quantum computers. While traditional cryptographic methods like RSA and ECC depend on the difficulty of mathematical problems (e.g., factoring large primes), quantum-safe encryption uses:

- **Lattice-Based Cryptography**
- **Code-Based Cryptography**
- **Multivariate Cryptography**
- **Hash-Based Cryptography**

These methods ensure that encrypted data remains secure even if quantum computers become powerful enough to break traditional encryption.
